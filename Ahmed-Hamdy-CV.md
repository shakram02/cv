## Skills
   C, C++, Rust, C#, Angular2 , Java, Android, Python, HTML, CSS, git, MySQL, Data structures, Linux, Design patterns

## Projects

### Assembler for SIC/XE machine
 Main target of this project is to learn and use a new language in such a short amount of time. `Rust` is a systems programming language by `Mozilla` that provides C capabilities plus memory and thread safety guarantees 

### Shixy the robot
I was lucky to have such a cool internship at [TMentors](http://tmentors.com/) Writing software that controls a remotely operated robot using `C#` and `WPF`. I learned a lot about design patterns and clean software design through that year

### File server 
Building a reliable protocol on top of UDP using `C++`, This was the final project for the Computer Networks course. I learned about modern `C++` and using its `std` library and its idioms such as RAII and move semantics. I chose `C++` as a language as I wanted to learn it through this period.

### Event planning system for IEEE | AlexSB
Aiming to learn `Angular2`, this project is used to organize the time slots for the volunteers in a given event, taking care of the collisions that might occur while allocating the volunteers.

### Arduino Network Manager
Using `Java`, this project was created for a client to control a network of `Arduino`s, The program monitors the state of the `Arduino`s in the network and sends them commands that are received by sketches running on the `Arduino`s

## Activities

-   **Microsoft Student Partner** 2015 – 2016 helped in spreading new technologies on campus and providing educational mails
-   **[IEEE | AlexSB volunteer](http://alexsb.org/)** Software & Technical Committees, Graphics - 2016 , instructed C and Arduino courses
-   **Programming & Robotics instructor** at [Protons](https://www.facebook.com/ProtonsAlexSB/) by IEEE AlexSB for 3 years - Arduino, C# and Python
-   **Human Computer Interaction** workshop at _STRA City_ we created a prototype for a tele-presence robot (Arduino,RPi,WebRTC,MQTT) it was more of a research experience where we applied user centric design principles
