\section{Experience}
\colorsubsec{Teaching Assistant, Alexandria University. Spring, 2019}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Assisted in teaching Data Structures and Computer Networks courses.
\end{itemize*}

\colorsubsec{Graphmented, BADR IT, Alexandria
	\\ Software Engineer | November till 31st, December, 2018}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Graphmented is an application to visualize data using AR Charts on iOS
	\item Self-learned how to use a Mac up to contributing using Swift + ARKit to production code in 8 working days
\end{itemize*}
% [Mohamed Azab, PhD - Ahmed Hamdy, Undergrad - Ahmed Mansour, MSc]
\colorsubsec{Repoxy: Replication Proxy for Trustworthy SDN Controller Operation  \\ TrustCom 2018 - \href{https://github.com/shakram02/Repoxy}{Github} - \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8455887/}{IEEEXplore}}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item The main contribution was enabling more than one controller to obtain the network state without knowing about the existence of each other, nor did the network know about the existence of the two controllers
	\item Implementation required knowledge with the OpenFlow protocol besides packet manipulation and crafting. I also implemented an Ansible like software to automate testing across VMs
\end{itemize*}

%  [Ahmed Hamdy, Grad - Yara Abdullatif, Undergrad - Shaimaa Lazem, PhD]
\colorsubsec{PI Floor: Portable Interactive Floor for Edutainment - MUM18 - \href{https://github.com/shakram02/PiFloor}{Github} -
	\href{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3282894.3289734}{ACM DL}}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item The main contribution of this poster was enabling education in rural areas by making an Android app that used paper tiles to represent an interactive grid where students can solve MCQ questions as a game where they move on the tiles to select the answer
	% \item This project won the 1st place in ACM CAIRO CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) chapter's competition
	\item The application utilized an embedded WebSockets and HTTP server to display an interactive grid on a remote for the players to track the questions and their progress
\end{itemize*}

\colorsubsec{Shixy [Advertisement Robot], TMentors, Cairo - Intern Software Engineer - October 2015 to August 2016}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Shixy is operated through another endpoint in the network based on a Windows mini PC and Arduino
	\item My role was to re-design and implement the solutions (C\#/WPF) on the pilot's PC and on the robot
	% \item The pilot's solution had a hardware joystick which I eventually replaced by a software one commands are sent over network to the robot's PC. The solution on the robot communicates with the Arduino which is responsible for the robot motion. It also featured image capturing and display
	\item Through the internship I self learned more about serial communication, design patterns, SOLID, WPF and Dependency Injection and used them in the implementation
\end{itemize*}
% \subsubsection{Projects:\\ SIC/XE Assembler (Team of 3) \href{https://github.com/oddcoder/sickassembler}{GitHub}}
% \begin{itemize*}
% 	\item Self-learned Rust language. Rust is a modern System development language by Mozilla and stepped though its learning curve successfully \href{https://www.rust-lang.org/}{rust-lang}
% 	\item I developed the parsing and transformation to intermediate representation stages
% 	% \item We followed code review system for each Pull Request and used Travis for automating our code testing and did extensive error checking for the input code files
% \end{itemize*}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item \textbf{Code Assembler} in Rust, implemented parsing and transformation to intermediate code
	\item \textbf{Arduino Network Controller} in Java, to manage a set of Arduinos in a network, connections were established using peer discovery
	\item \textbf{Smart home lock} Trying to implement some ideas from Amazon lock by creating a web server which accepts One Time Passwords to open a lock controlled by an Arduino connected to the server
	\item \textbf{Minesweeper Robot} This was a robot that we implemented for a local competition that scans a grid area and displays the map on a PC. I was responsible for major parts in the Arduino code, designing the main Arduino Shield and the C\# application
	\item \textbf{Ticketing system} Implemented on intel's 8051 microcontroller. I used 2 7-Segments to display the current number using timer interrupts and pin interrupts to increment the current client number
\end{itemize*}

\section{Certifications}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Computer and Communications department, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University [Jul, 2018] %GPA: 3.09
	\item TOEFL(IBT) [Oct, 2018] \BoldIt{Score: 106}
\end{itemize*}
