## Projects

**Assembler for SIC/XE machine**

 Aiming to learn `Rust`, this program creates object code from input assembly file, it has unit tests, a robust error checks and modular design

**Shixy the robot**

 At my internship at [TMentors](http://tmentors.com/) Writing software that controls a remotely operated robot using `C#` and `WPF` and communicating with the `Arduino` that controlled the motors. and then moved to `Xamarin` to control the robot from mobile phones

**File server**

Using modern `C++`, I implemented GoBackN algorithm on top of UDP to make reliable file transfer, it could also server multiple clients each one on a separate thread.

**Event planning system for IEEE | AlexSB**

Using `Angular2`, this web app is used to organize the time slots for the volunteers in a given event and showing collisions between the time slots if they occur

**Arduino Network Manager**

Using `Java`, this project controls a network of `Arduino`s, The program monitors the state of the `Arduino`s in the network and sends and queries the state of them

**SMS AdBlocker**

Using `Kotlin` after Google announced its support for Android, this project aims to block annoying SMS Ads by the service providers and filter them away

**Power Tray**

Using `C#` I created this gadget when I was a windows user to change the power settings in a succinct manner directly from a task bar tray. This gadget was selected to be featured on [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Power-Tray.shtml)
