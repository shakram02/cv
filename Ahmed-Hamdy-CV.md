A self-motivated software engineer who **asbtraction, modularity and separation of concerns comes to naturally**. Seeking the best available opportunities. I **love open source culture** and **in my free time, I read books** about systems, low level programming and **scanning the internet for waht's new in technology**.
Abstracting myself to an "array of characters" in this CV creates a shear amount of information loss. Accordingly, What follows is just a subset of me.
