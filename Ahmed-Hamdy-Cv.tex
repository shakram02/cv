\section{Experience}

\colorsubsec{Graphmented, BADRIT (Now Incorta Inc.), Alexandria
	\\ Software Engineer | November till 31st, December, 2018}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Graphmented is an application to visualize data using AR Charts on iOS
	\item Designed and developed features while keeping in mind OOD and SOLID principles
	\item Self-learned how to use a Mac up to contributing using Swift + ARKit to production code in 8 working days
\end{itemize*}

\colorsubsec{Repoxy: Replication Proxy for Trustworthy SDN Controller Operation  \\ TrustCom 2018 - \href{https://github.com/shakram02/Repoxy}{Github} - \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8455887/}{IEEEXplore}}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item This paper was oriented towards controller security in SDN using controller redundancy
	\item The main contribution was enabling more than one controller to obtain the network state without knowing about the existence of each other, nor did the network know about the existence of the two controllers
	\item Implementation required knowledge with the OpenFlow protocol besides packet manipulation and crafting. I also implemented an Ansible like software to automate testing across VMs
\end{itemize*}

\colorsubsec{PI Floor: Portable Interactive Floor with High Resilience and Minimal Setup for Edutainment \\ MUM18 - \href{https://github.com/shakram02/PiFloor}{Github} -
	\href{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3282894.3289734}{ACM DL}}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item The main contribution of this poster was enabling education in areas with little resources through making an Android app that used paper tiles to represent an interactive grid where students can solve MCQ questions as a game where they move on the tiles to select the answer
	\item This project won the 1st place in ACM CAIRO CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) chapter's competition
	\item The application utilized an embedded WebSockets and HTTP server, using Android vision and a VueJS app
\end{itemize*}

\colorsubsec{Shixy, TMentors, Cairo - Intern Software Engineer - October 2015 to August 2016}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Shixy is an advertisement robot that's operated through another endpoint in the network based on a Windows mini PC and Arduino
	\item My role was to re-design and implement the solutions (C\#/WPF) on the pilot's PC and on the robot
	\item The pilot's solution had a hardware joystick which I eventually replaced by a software one commands are sent over network to the robot's PC. The solution on the robot communicates with the Arduino which is responsible for the robot motion. It also featured image capturing and display
	\item Through the internship I self learned design patterns, SOLID, WPF and Dependency Injection and used them in the implementation
\end{itemize*}
\subsubsection{Project: SIC/XE Assembler (Team of 3) \href{https://github.com/oddcoder/sickassembler}{GitHub}}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Self-learned Rust language. Rust is a modern System development language by Mozilla. \href{https://www.rust-lang.org/}{rust-lang}
	\item Rust is a mixed paradigm language that offers C++ power and automatic memory management at compile time through the Ownership model, which gives it an initial  learning curve
	\item We followed code review system for each Pull Request and used Travis for automating our code testing and did extensive error checking for the input code files

\end{itemize*}
\section{Certifications}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Computer and Communications department, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University [Jul, 2018] %GPA: 3.09
	\item TOEFL(IBT) [Oct, 2018] \BoldIt{Score: 106}
\end{itemize*}
\section{Languages and Technologies [Self-taught]}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item C++, Python, Arduino, Kotlin, Java, Rust, Android, Git, \LaTeX, Linux and NodeJs. Basic: Machine Learning
\end{itemize*}
\section{Extracurricular Activities}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item IEEE | Student volunteer; Taught C, Arduino courses and I was an instructor for an educational program that teaches programming (C\#,Python) and Robotics (Arduino) to middle and high school students
	\item Microsoft Student Partner | 2015 - 2016. On campus event planning
	% \item Attended trainings by Microsoft employees in Cairo
	\item MUM18 Organizing Student Volunteer with international volunteers and organization committee
	\item AIESEC Exchange Participant; Educational project in Indonesia. Volunteers were from 10 different countries
	% \item I blog about Arduino and IoT-ish projects on Hackster
\end{itemize*}
