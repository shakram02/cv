## Skills

Rust, C, C++, Kotlin, C\#, Java, Python, git, Linux, Machine learning, Angular2, Gulp, Nodejs

## Projects

I use projects to learn new languages and technologies in a short amount of time, this is pretty much fun and challenging

**Assembler for SIC/XE machine**

Using `Rust`, this program creates object code from input assembly file, it has unit tests, a robust error checks and modular design

**Shixy the robot**

At my internship at [TMentors](http://tmentors.com/) Writing software that controls a remotely operated robot using `C#` and `WPF` using `Prism` and using component based architecture, containers and interface dependencies. Subcomponents were a camera viewer, slide show, socket connector to the pilot's side.

**File server**

Using modern `C++`, I implemented GoBackN algorithm on top of UDP to make reliable file transfer, it could also server multiple clients each one on a separate thread.

**Bash Beautify**

A simple `vscode` extension to format bash script in `Nodejs` that spawns a child `python` script process to format the current source file, find it on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shakram02.bash-beautify)

**Arduino Network Manager**

Using `Java`, this project controls a network of `Arduino`s, The program monitors the state of the `Arduino`s in the network and sends and queries the state of them

**SMS AdBlocker**

Using `Kotlin` after Google announced its support for Android, this project aims to block annoying SMS Ads by the service providers and filter them away

**Power Tray**

Using `C#` I created this gadget when I was a windows user to change the power settings in a succinct manner directly from a task bar tray. This gadget was selected to be featured on [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Power-Tray.shtml)
